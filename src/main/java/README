This app, virtual-pets-amok, is an extension of the virtual-pet-shelter app.

The shelter has now added robotic pets and displays the value of their oil level, as they do not have hunger or thirst. Actions have been altered to
affect multiple values, as opposed to just one. A litterbox used by all cats (we know that's not how it works in real life) can now be cleaned and dogs
now have cages that get dirtier as time goes by. The format of the app (pet status display, menu, etc.) has been edited to be more informational,
functional, and aesthetic.
